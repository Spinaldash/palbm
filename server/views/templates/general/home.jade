        .lead Welcome~
        p Welcome to MJ's image corner. This project is something I built from scratch while learning how to code with hapy.js, jade, mongoose, and mongodb. I also am practicing my CSS styling and learning more about bootstrap.

        .lead The Specifics:
        p For this project in particular, we integrated Amazon Web Services, so that you can upload a photo and it will be hosted by AWS yet still displayed here. I built this on Friday, Feb. 20, 2015. It took me about 8 hours and 1 nap.
